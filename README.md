# Siemens SOA .NET + Python Example Projects

This repository contains example Python projects demonstrating how to use the Siemens Teamcenter SOA .NET API with `pythonnet` and the provided stub files.

## Purpose

These examples showcase practical usage patterns, such as connecting to a Teamcenter server, making SOA service calls, and working with common objects â€” all using Python with type support via `.pyi` stubs.

## Highlights

- Example usage of `pythonnet` to interact with SOA DLLs
- Integration with type stubs for better autocompletion and development experience
- Common Teamcenter operations implemented in Python

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pythonnet` installed (`pip install pythonnet`)
- Access to SOA .NET DLLs and a Teamcenter environment

## Recommendations

Use [PyTc-stubs](https://github.com/jhrdina0/PyTC-stubs) for type information, autocompletion and documentation.
